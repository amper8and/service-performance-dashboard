# GitHub Authorization - Step-by-Step Guide

## 🔐 Complete GitHub Authorization

Follow these steps carefully:

---

## Step 1: Locate the GitHub Tab

Look at the **top of your interface** for tabs or navigation. You should see something like:

- **#github** tab
- Or a **GitHub** button/link
- Or **Settings** → **GitHub**
- Or **Integrations** → **GitHub**

**Common locations:**
- Top navigation bar
- Left sidebar
- Settings menu
- Integration/Connect section

If you can't find it, look for:
- A GitHub icon (the cat logo)
- Text that says "Connect GitHub" or "Authorize GitHub"
- A settings gear icon that might contain GitHub options

---

## Step 2: Click on GitHub/Authorization

Once you find it, click on it. You should see one of these screens:

### Option A: GitHub App Authorization
You'll see:
- "Authorize GitHub App"
- "Install GitHub App"
- A button to connect your GitHub account

### Option B: OAuth Authorization
You'll see:
- "Connect to GitHub"
- "Sign in with GitHub"
- "Authorize application"

---

## Step 3: Complete the Authorization Flow

### If GitHub Opens in a New Window/Tab:

1. **Sign in to GitHub** (if not already signed in)
   - Username: `amper8and`
   - Password: Your GitHub password

2. **Review Permissions**
   - The app will request certain permissions
   - Typically: read/write access to repositories
   - Review and confirm these are acceptable

3. **Click "Authorize" or "Install"**
   - Green button usually says "Authorize [App Name]"
   - Or "Install GitHub App"

4. **Select Repositories**
   - You may be asked which repositories to grant access to
   - Options:
     - "All repositories" (easiest)
     - "Only select repositories" (choose service-performance-dashboard)
   
5. **Confirm Installation**
   - Click "Install" or "Confirm"

---

## Step 4: Wait for Success Message

After authorization, you should see:

- ✅ "Successfully connected to GitHub"
- ✅ "GitHub authorized"
- ✅ A green checkmark or success indicator
- Your GitHub username (`amper8and`) displayed

---

## Step 5: Notify Me

Once you see the success message, come back here and type:

**"Authorization complete"** or **"Done"**

Then I'll immediately push your code to GitHub!

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the GitHub tab"

Try these:

1. **Look for these terms in your interface:**
   - GitHub
   - Git
   - Version Control
   - Integrations
   - Connections
   - Settings

2. **Check these locations:**
   - Top menu bar
   - Left sidebar
   - Right sidebar
   - Settings/preferences
   - User menu (your profile icon)

3. **Alternative approach:**
   If you absolutely can't find it, we can use **Option 2** (manual push with Personal Access Token). Just let me know!

### "Authorization failed" or "Error"

If you see an error:

1. **Try again** - Sometimes it's just a temporary glitch
2. **Check you're signed into GitHub** in your browser
3. **Disable ad blockers** - They can interfere with OAuth
4. **Try a different browser** - Chrome/Firefox usually work best
5. **Let me know the error message** - I can help troubleshoot

### "Which permissions should I grant?"

Grant these permissions:
- ✅ **Read access to repositories** (required)
- ✅ **Write access to repositories** (required to push code)
- ✅ **Workflows** (required for GitHub Actions)
- ❌ **Delete repositories** (NOT needed, can deny)

## 📸 What to Look For

The authorization screen typically shows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [GitHub Logo]                          │
│                                         │
│  Authorize Application                  │
│                                         │
│  [App Name] by [Provider]               │
│  wants to access your amper8and account │
│                                         │
│  This will allow the app to:           │
│  • Read your repositories               │
│  • Write to your repositories           │
│  • Manage workflows                     │
│                                         │
│  [ Authorize ] [ Cancel ]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## ⏱️ How Long It Takes

The entire authorization process typically takes:
- **30 seconds to 2 minutes** if everything goes smoothly
- You'll click through 2-4 screens
- Then see a success message

---

## 🎯 What Happens After Authorization

Once you complete authorization and notify me:

1. ✅ I'll **immediately push** your 13 commits to GitHub
2. ✅ All 30 files will be uploaded
3. ✅ Your repository will have all the code
4. ✅ Then you'll enable GitHub Pages (I'll guide you)
5. ✅ Your dashboard will be live in 2-3 minutes!

## 💡 Quick Tip

**Keep this window open** while doing the authorization in another tab/window, so you can come back here easily to let me know when you're done!

---

**Ready? Go ahead and look for the GitHub tab/button now. I'm here to help if you get stuck!**

Just let me know:
- ✅ "Found it!" - when you locate the GitHub tab
- ✅ "Authorizing..." - when you're in the flow
- ✅ "Done!" - when you see the success message
- ❓ "Can't find it" - if you need more help locating it

Take your time! 🚀
